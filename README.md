# NOTE
This repo is modified the previous script to install on newer Jetson TX2 platform which is built on L4T 32.0 using JetPack 4.2. 

The following is the old instruction. The new instruction should follow the same procedure but with modifled scripts.

--------------------

# installRACECARJ
<em>January, 2018</em>

Scripts in this repository will install ROS and the MIT RACECAR packages on a NVIDIA Jetson Development Kit.

This version is for L4T 28.1
The scripts assume that the Jetson has been freshly flashed with L4T 28.1 using JetPack 3.1.
JetPack must also install:
<ul>
<li>CUDA 8.0</li>
<li>cuDNN 6.0</li>
<li>OpenCV4Tegra 2.4.13</li>
</ul>

<em>Note that this repository is currently under heavy development, and is subject to change soon.
</em>

<h2>MIT RACECAR Configuration Installation</h2>

The MIT RACECAR supported here is version 2.5. The hardware configuration includes a Stereolabs ZED camera, Hokuyo UST-10LX scanning range finder, and SparkFun SEN-14001 IMU. 

The file installMITRACECAR.sh will install the full ROS stack and MIT RACECAR software. Before running installMITRACECAR.sh, the Stereolabs ZED camera driver must be installed (see scripts below). The ZED camera driver is available at: https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/ in the archive section.


The installation script:

$ ./installMITRACECAR.sh racecar-ws

Does the following:

<ul>
<li>L4T 28.1 does not have a cdc-acm driver. The script installs a pre-built cdc-acm driver. <em>The driver expects a stock kernel (4.4.38-tegra)</em></li>
<li>Because the electronic speed controller and the IMU both report as ttyACM, a udev rule is installed which names them as vesc and imu respectively.</li>
<li>ROS is configured and rosbase is installed</li>
<li>One of the dependencies is missing in the package specifications, so ros-kinetic-opencv3 is installed.</li>
<li>The MIT RACECAR packages are installed, which includes the ZED v2.2.x ROS wrapper.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Stereolabs ZED Drivers</h2>
Scripts are provided to install version 2.2.1 of the Stereolabs ZED drivers. These drivers match the JetPack 3.1/L4T 28.1 software with CUDA 8.0. The scripts are in the JetsonTX1 and JetsonTX2 repositories. Select the appropriate script for your machine, e.g. installZED-SDK-TX2.sh for the Jetson TX2.
Usage (for example):

$ ./installZED-SDK-TX2.sh

The ZED installer will be placed in the home directory, ~/ZED

Next, the ZED installer will install the ZED driver software.

Note that the driver installer is in ~/ZED, not the ZED driver itself.

<h2>Helper Scripts</h2>
Included in the full software installs, provided here for convenience.


<h3>installROS.sh</h3>
Adds the ROS sources list, sets the keys and then loads ros-kinetic-ros-base. Edit this file to add other ROS packages for your installation. After loading, rosdep is initialized.
 
<h3>setupCatkinWorkspace.sh</h3>
Usage:

$ ./setupCatkinWorkspace.sh [optionalWorkspaceName]

where optionalWorkspaceName is the name of the workspace to be used. The default workspace name is catkin_ws. Included in the full software installs, provided here for convenience.



### Note
The ROS environment variables ROS_MASTER_URI and ROS_IP are initialized in the file ~/.bashrc

You will need to modify these environment variables to match your needs and network layout.
